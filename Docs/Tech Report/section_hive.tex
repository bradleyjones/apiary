\section{Hive}

Our core, and most complex component - its role is to manage data agents
(Bees), store incoming log data, and provide complex querying against that
data. In order to achieve scalability, Hive is made up of 6 subcomponents, with
a simple framework in place for extending this with extra components should the
user require additional functionality. All components communicate over the
RabbitMQ message exchange.

Given our background with OpenStack (written in Python) and the abundance of
bindings and support for many of the other technologies we wanted to employ,
Python was the obvious language choice for Hive. Python also provided a clean
multiprocessing library which was crucial for a number of subcomponents. We
chose to implement a common MVC stack for all our components, along with a JSON
protocol that would be shared across the whole stack. This allowed us to
rapidly prototype and add new components to Hive as all the communication
management and database access code were broken out into a reusable library.
