\section{iOS Application}

In the real world a user will not always be sitting in front of their computer
when they need to know something about the computer system being monitored by
Apiary. However, it is likely that they will be carrying a modern smartphone
with them almost all the time, which will have a reasonably consistent WiFi or
cellular data connection. Due to our GUI being entirely web-based a user could
access everything they need to know using their smartphones web browser, but by
creating a native application we can enhance the user experience and provide
added functionality. A small but significantly useful function is the ability to
save the Apiary URL for the environment being monitored between invocations of
the application - speeding up a users access to the system. We can also save the
users login credentials for the same reason.

The greatest argument for a native application is the ability to exploit the
powerful Apple Push Notification System. As described above in the Sting
section, APNS can be used to send the user real-time updates on the status of
their computer system at anytime, as long as they have a cellular/WiFi data
connection. When a user logs into Apiary using the iOS application, their
unique Apple Device ID is registered against their user account to be used by
Sting for alert notifications.
